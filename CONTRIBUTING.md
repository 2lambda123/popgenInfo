#Creating and submitting workflow vignettes

##What is a workflow vignette?
Workflow vignettes are documents that outline a population genetics based bioinformatics workflow involving one or more R packages. These workflows are based around biological questions/topics and the type of data being used and are generally more extensive than those found in package vignettes. They are intended to provide R users with the necessary code and examples to solve any biological questions that they have. 

The analysis outlined in the vignettes should take as little time as possible to run, ideally approximately two minutes. For example, if you are running permutations, set these to a small number in the workflow and encourage the user to increase the number themselves.
