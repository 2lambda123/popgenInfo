title: "Writing R Packages"

# Introduction

The following tutorials are meant to give you a basic starting point that can
enable you to write packages for population genetic analysis. These are not 
designed to be a comprehensive guide for package development. There are MANY
tutorials available that describe development in detail (some examples are in
the dropdown menu). **The vignettes here are designed to show you how to develop
packages so that they can be easily integrated with the broader community of 
population genetics in R**. With these tools in R, population genetic analysis
can become more available and reproducible.


# Resources for writing R packages

Below are some resources that can get you started writing R packages. 

 - [Hadley Wickham's Guide For Creating R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
 - [Jeff Leek's R Package Development](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages)
 - [S4 Classes in detail](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html)
 - [S3 Classes in detail](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html)
 - [A not so short introduction to S4](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Genolini-S4tutorialV0-5en.pdf)
