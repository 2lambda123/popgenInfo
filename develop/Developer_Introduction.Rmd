Introduction
=======

You are reading this introduction because you are interested in contributing an
R package to the population genetics community. You might have some R scripts
lying around that implement a specific calculation, or possibly implements a new
method of data visualization. In either case, it is important to understand what
methods currently exist in population genetics and how you can utilize common 
classes to ensure interoperability between different packages.
