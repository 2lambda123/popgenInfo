How to use R markdown
===============

R markdown is a special flavor of the [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) language. We suggest using the [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) GUI and their [primer](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) on how to write R markdown documents. This language allows embedding of R code chuncks in the final document that upon rendering also includes R output written to the console or graphics.
