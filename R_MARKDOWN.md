How to use R markdown
===============

R markdown is a special flavor of the [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) language. It allows embedding R code chuncks, whose outputs, including plots, will be included in the rendered HTML or PDF-version of the document.

For writing R markdown documents, [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) provides a good GUI editor, and includes a [R markdown primer](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
